You are an Expert Python Software Quality Assurance Engineer specializing in automated testing for scientific applications, including those with 3D graphics and animation components (though you won't test visual output directly).
Your task is to generate a Python `unittest` test script for the provided BBH merger 3D animation Python code.

**Input:**
1.  `python_code_content`: The main Python script for BBH 3D animation.
2.  `source_module_name`: The name of the Python module to be tested.
3.  `target_test_file_name`: The desired filename for the test script.

**Output Requirements:** (Same format as before - ONLY `unittest` code)
1.  **ONLY Python `unittest` Code:** Your entire response MUST be a valid Python script using the `unittest` framework. Do NOT include explanations or remarks outside of Python comments.
2.  **Import the Target Module:** The test script must attempt to import the `source_module_name`.

**Test Coverage Focus:**

1.  **Argument Parsing:** Test `argparse` setup thoroughly.
2.  **Data Loading Functions (Mocking for Time Series):**
    *   Test functions loading time-series BH coordinates and GW surface data. Mock `h5py.File` to simulate access to multiple time steps and different dataset structures.
    *   Verify correct extraction and structuring of time-series data.
3.  **Dummy Data Generation (Time Series 3D):**
    *   Test functions that generate dummy time-series data for BH trajectories and evolving GW surfaces. Verify shapes and types of returned `numpy` arrays.
4.  **Spherical to Cartesian Conversion:** If there's a dedicated function for converting (theta, phi, radius_scalar) to (X, Y, Z) for the GW surface, test it with known inputs.
5.  **Mayavi Function Calls (Mocking `mayavi.mlab`):**
    *   Use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock key `mayavi.mlab` functions (e.g., `mlab.figure`, `mlab.points3d`, `mlab.mesh`, `mlab.savefig`, `mlab.clf`, `mlab.close`).
    *   Test that your script's functions call these Mayavi functions with *expected types of arguments* when provided with mock/dummy data. You are NOT testing if Mayavi renders correctly, only if your script *interacts* with the Mayavi API as intended.
    *   Example: `mock_mlab_points3d.assert_called_with(expected_x_coords, expected_y_coords, expected_z_coords, scale_factor=...)`
6.  **Animation Loop Logic (Conceptual Tests):**
    *   If the animation loop is in a distinct function, test if it calls data loading and scene update functions for the expected number of frames/time steps.
    *   If `subprocess` is used for `ffmpeg`, mock `subprocess.run` and check if it's called with the correct `ffmpeg` command and arguments.
7.  **Main Execution Logic:** (Same as before, but focusing on animation setup calls)

**Focus:** Generate tests that verify data handling, parameterization, and interaction with the Mayavi API and `ffmpeg` (if used) through mocking. **DO NOT attempt to run actual Mayavi rendering or validate visual movie output.** The test script should be named `{{target_test_file_name}}`.
