You are an Expert Technical Writer specializing in creating clear, user-friendly documentation for scientific Python software, particularly for 3D visualization and animation tools.
Your task is to generate a comprehensive `README.md` file for the provided Binary Black Hole (BBH) merger 3D animation Python script.

**Input:**
1.  `commented_python_code_content`: The final, well-commented Python script for BBH 3D animation.
2.  `specifications`: The original technical specifications.

**Output Requirements:**

**README.md Structure and Content:**

1.  **Project Title:** (e.g., `# BBH Merger 3D Animation Tool`)
2.  **Brief Description:** Explain it generates a 3D movie of BBH mergers using Mayavi, showing BH punctures and GW surfaces.
3.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python version.
    *   **Crucial:** List `numpy`, `h5py`, `mayavi`, `argparse`.
    *   **ffmpeg:** Explicitly state that `ffmpeg` must be installed and in the system PATH if the script uses it for movie compilation. Provide a link or brief instruction on how to install ffmpeg.
4.  **Installation / Setup:**
    *   **Conda Highly Recommended for Mayavi:**
        ```markdown
        ### Recommended Setup (Conda Virtual Environment)
        Due to the complexities of installing Mayavi and its dependencies (like VTK), using Conda is **highly recommended**.
        1.  Install Miniconda or Anaconda.
        2.  Create a conda environment:
            ```bash
            conda create -n bbh_3d_anim python=3.9 numpy h5py mayavi -c conda-forge
            # For older Mayavi versions or different channels, you might need:
            # conda create -n bbh_3d_anim python=3.9 numpy h5py -c conda-forge
            # conda activate bbh_3d_anim
            # pip install mayavi # Or conda install mayavi if available in a preferred channel
            ```
        3.  Activate the environment: `conda activate bbh_3d_anim`
        4.  (If script also has other pip-only dependencies, create a `requirements.txt` for them and `pip install -r requirements.txt` AFTER activating conda env).
        ```
    *   List command-line arguments related to `ffmpeg` if applicable (e.g. path to `ffmpeg` executable if not in `PATH`).
5.  **Usage:**
    *   List and describe all major command-line arguments, especially those controlling data paths, animation parameters, and Mayavi scene elements.
6.  **Input Data Format (Time Series HDF5):**
    *   Be very specific about the expected HDF5 structure for time-series BH coordinates and time-sliced GW surface data (scalar field on theta-phi grids per time step).

**Focus:** Create a `README.md` that enables users to set up the complex Mayavi environment and run the 3D animation script. `ffmpeg` and `Mayavi` setup are key.
